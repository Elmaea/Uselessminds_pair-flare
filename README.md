### Project Description
A simple, fun and engaging website that lets your taste bubs go wild with the various combinations of food.
THere are mainly two features:
1) When the user clicks "Generate Snack Pair," the page presents a randomly selected, quirky snack combination with an image and description.
2) Users can rate each snack pairing by clicking on a star rating (1 to 5 stars) after trying a snack combination.
3) A compactibility test for food items.


### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
The problem of "snack fatigue", the desperate feeling of wanting to eat something that has been barely tried by 1/3rd of the human population.
### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
A colorful webiste that not only keeps you wanting for more but also makes you try all the different weird combinations and rate them. Added feature of finding the compactibility of two food items.
